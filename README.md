# Overview

The software is a list manipulation program written in Erlang. It allows users to perform various operations on lists, such as reversing a list, finding the length of a list, and checking if a list is a palindrome. Additionally, the program demonstrates error handling by throwing and catching exceptions when invalid inputs are provided.

The purpose of developing this software is to learn the Erlang programming language and its unique features, such as pattern matching, recursion, and fault-tolerant design through exception handling. This project also aims to deepen understanding of functional programming concepts and improve skills in working with lists.
